## Lab Specific Tasks

### Intentional and Incremental Programming

1. Why is intentional programming important?

2. Why is incremental programming important?

### Trace debugging

3. In the lab files for this repository, go to the `trace-debug` folder. There you will find a library, an implementation, and a main file. Buggy functions have been included in the `math.c` file. Your job is to debug them using the trace debugging method and ensure that all of them work properly.

4. Explain where each function went wrong and how you fixed it

### Using a Debugger
**For this section of the lab, copy some old code from either the _Image_ or _Data_ lab into the `gdb-debug` folder. Follow the instructions in `instructions.txt` and answer the questions below.**


5. Take a screenshot of your breakpoint successfully working and call it `breakpoint.png`.

![breakpoint](./breakpoint.png)

6. Take a screenshot of you stepping into a function that isn't main `stepover.png`

![stepover](./stepover.png)

7. Put a breakpoint in an area where a variable is being assigned a value. Take a screenshot of the debugging panel showing the variable value and call it `value.png`.

![value](./value.png)

### Analyzing Assembly
8. Take a screenshot of setting a breakpoint in the assembly file and label it `asm_breakpoint.png`.

![asm_breakpoint](./asm_breakpoint.png)

9. Take a screenshot of setting a stepping to a different line in the assembly file and label it `asm_step.png`.

![asm_step](./asm_step.png)

10. Print out a value of a register in the assembly file. If you get stuck on how to do this, do a little research on 'printing assembly registers gdb'. Take a screenshot and save it as `asm_print.png`.

![asm_print](./asm_print.png)

### Reflection

11. Look up some `gdb` alternatives. List one and something different it does that `gdb` does not.
